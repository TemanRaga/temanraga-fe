## Inspiration

Doing exercise is the basis for starting a healthy life in addition to a healthy diet. Sports games such as badminton, basketball, ball, and others require not only one person. In this digital era, there is a shift in activities such as sleeping all day, playing games, or watching Netflix all day. Have you ever wanted to play futsal or soccer but none of your friends want to be invited to play. Yes, we also have, this can have an impact on demotivation to do sports. If a person has been demotivated, it will start a domino effect starting from not exercising, having an irregular lifestyle and eventually causing obesity or other diseases. As happened in Indonesia, the problem of obesity has increased twice based on the Indonesian basic health research department 2018 and will continue to increase every year. Otherwise, based on research from Badan Pusat Statistik, people in Indonesia that actively doing sport regularly are just 35,7 percent of the entire Indonesian population.By leveraging technology, we see an opportunity to lower that number by motivating others to exercise and providing healthy tips. We found that one of the factors for motivation in sports is having friends who make the sport fun. That's the reason we built this platform.

## What it does
Our app helps people in finding them friends to do sports together. With this application, users can participate in sporting events created by official organizers such as danone, who, and others. In addition, users can create their own sporting events that other users can participate in.

## How we built it
TemanRaga integrated some technology to make the functionalities

- Django Rest Framework
- PostgreSQL
- NextJS
- GCP
- Design with Figma and UI Components with Chakra UI
- Docker
- Nginx

## Challenges we ran into
- Collaborating with others online
- Distribution of tasks
- The short timeframe
- First time doing hackton
- Delivery our app to cloud (GCP, etc)
- Bug that we built by our hand

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learn a problem quickly, fast platform development and solid group work.

## What we learned
We learned how to use and integrate GoogleCloud with our app. Otherwise, we learned how to do project management and learned that we should plan our ideas ahead, instead of unnecessary detail that took time. We learned how to manage (tremendously) short to deliver useful app.

## What's next for TemanRaga
Add more feature, especially to be more mobile friendly and having its own app for mobile. It should have group chat between participants on the activities. So, it can contact and coordinate each others to join the event. Also, we need more tips about sport, health, and anything related to it.
